# Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) – Research Code Repository

This repository collects all the code, experiments, and utilities developed and used during my internship on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The goal of this project is to explore, implement, and benchmark PINN-based approaches for solving physics-based forward and inverse problems, with a focus on materials science, semiconductor physics, and coupled PDE systems.

The repository is intended as a research sandbox: modular, reproducible, and extensible, supporting both rapid prototyping and well-documented numerical experiments.

## Project Scope

This repository includes:
- Core implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks

- Forward and inverse problem formulations

- Loss functions combining data fidelity and physical constraints

- Applications to partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to:

- Charge transport and diffusion

This repository explores PINNs for both:

Forward problems (solving PDEs given parameters)

Inverse problems (inferring unknown parameters, coefficients, or sources)
